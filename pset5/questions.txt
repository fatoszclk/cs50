0.  The maximum BMP resolution is 24 bit, or 2^24. Thus, BMP can support 2^24 colors, or 16777216 colors. Gif supports up to 8 bits
    per pixel, which means that a gif image can support upto 256 colors from a 24-bit RGB color palette. JPEG supports nearly 16.7 million
    colors. PNG is similar to JPEG in that it also supports over 16 million colors.
1.  Out of the four file formats, only GIF supports animation.
2.  Lossless compressions means that an image is made smaller without sacrificing its quality. Lossy compression means that the image
    is made small, but sacrifices the quality of the image.
3.  Of the 4 file formats, only JPEG is lossy-compressed.
4.  The file data is not actually deleted, but merely the referece to that data is deleted.
5.  Completely destroy the hard-drive, corrupt it by running a magnet over it, or overwriting the data on the hard drive.
6.  stdint.h is a header file that provides a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types and defines corresponding sets of macros.
7.  They allow the programmer to define a typedef and define variables. In other words, they are a type of unsigned integer of a certain length. 
8.  BYTE is 8 bits (1 byte); DWORD is 32 bits (4 bytes); LONG is 32 bits (4 bytes); and WORD is 16 bits (2 bytes).
9.  In ASCII, the first 2 bytes of a BMP file is 'B' and then 'M.'
10. The  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file, while biSize is the number of bytes required by the program's structure.
11. When biHeight is negative, the bitmap is top down DIB and its origin is in the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount specifies the color depth.
13. If outfile was not properly given in the command line, fopen may return NULL.
14. Because there is only one object which the function reads.
15. Padding will be 4.
16. fseek sets the file position data in a given file.
17. SEEK_CUR  seeks the origin value of fseek from the current location.
18. Milo Banana dun it.
