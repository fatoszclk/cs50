0.  Technically, the word refers to a lung disease that is caused when inhaling fine parts of silica or quartz.
    It is, however, an invented term to only serve as the longest English word.
1.  To get resource usage. In other words, it returns resource usage measures of various statistics.
2.  Three members: RUSAGE_SELF, RUSAGE_CHILDREN and RUSAGE_THREAD.
3.  before and after are pointers. It would probably be more efficient to just pass a pointer than actually inputting
    the before and after values from the struct.
4.  The for loop spell checks each word character-by-character. It appends chracters to the word array while ignoring
    numbers and strings that have more than the given, fixed length. Then, once it reaches the end of the string, the function
    prepares for a new word. Once a whole word is found, the current word in the word array is terminated, the counter is updated,
    and the spelling is checked. If the word is misspelled, the function prints that word. Then it once again prepares
    for the next word.
5.  fgetc only deals with chracters, so we need not worry about non-characters like numbers or symbols.
6.  The string parameters for check and load do not need to be altered within those functions.
7.  I used hashtables. Each node was supposed to get a word and have a pointer to the next and formed a linked array.
8.  n/a
9.  n/a
10. If collisions can be avoided or minimized (as it happens with hashtables), the program would be more efficient probably.
